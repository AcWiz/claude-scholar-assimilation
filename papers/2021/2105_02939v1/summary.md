## TL;DR
This paper introduces PCE-PINNs, a novel method combining Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to enable fast uncertainty propagation in ocean modeling. The approach learns PCE coefficients directly from observations using neural networks, providing a computationally lightweight surrogate model that avoids expensive ensemble simulations while maintaining physical constraints.

## Research Question
How can physics-informed neural networks enable fast uncertainty quantification for climate model parameters when traditional ensemble simulations are computationally prohibitive due to the high resolution requirements (8-25km horizontal resolution) of ocean models?

## Method Summary
PCE-PINNs combines polynomial chaos expansion, a classic uncertainty propagation technique, with physics-informed neural networks to learn a fast surrogate model. The method approximates stochastic functions via polynomial chaos expansion while leveraging neural networks to estimate PCE coefficients in high-dimensional spaces, enabling rapid inference of uncertainty distributions without expensive ensemble runs.

### Pipeline
1. **Problem Formulation**: Define stochastic partial differential equation (PDE) with uncertain parameters (e.g., stochastic diffusivity κ(z;ω))
2. **PCE Representation**: Express the stochastic solution as a finite sum of polynomial chaos basis functions with unknown coefficients
3. **Neural Network Architecture**: Design a neural network to predict PCE coefficients as functions of space and time
4. **Physics-Informed Training**: Train the network by enforcing both observational data constraints and PDE physics residuals
5. **Uncertainty Inference**: Use learned PCE coefficients to compute statistical moments (mean, variance) and propagate parameter uncertainties

### Core Modules
- **Stochastic PDE Solver Module**: Embeds neural network in the solution space of the advection-diffusion equation
- **PCE Coefficient Estimator**: Neural network architecture that outputs PCE coefficients for arbitrary spatial-temporal coordinates
- **Gaussian Process Diffusivity Generator**: Generates samples of stochastic diffusivity κ(z;ω) = exp(Yκ(z;ω)) using exponential GP prior
- **Physics Residual Loss**: Penalizes deviation from governing PDE physics

### Technical & Physics Fusion
The method embeds domain physics in two ways: (1) The neural network learns the solution structure of the advection-diffusion PDE rather than arbitrary functions, and (2) training enforces the PDE residual as a physics-informed loss term. This ensures predictions respect conservation laws and physical constraints even with limited observational data.

## Math & Physics Modeling

### Optimization Objective
The loss function combines:
- **Data Fidelity Term**: L_data = ||T_pred - T_observed||² (supervision from limited solution measurements)
- **Physics Residual Term**: L_physics = ||N[T_pred]||² (PDE residual enforcement)
- **PCE Orthogonality Constraint**: Optional regularization ensuring PCE basis function orthogonality

### Key Equations/Physics
**Stochastic Advection-Diffusion Equation:**
$$\frac{\partial T(t,z;\omega)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(wT(t,z;\omega))}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(\kappa(z;\omega)\frac{\partial T(t,z;\omega)}{\partial z}\right) = f$$

where:
- T: Temperature (solution field)
- z ∈ [0,1]: Vertical spatial domain
- t ∈ [0,1]: Temporal domain
- w = 10: Constant vertical velocity
- κ(z;ω): Stochastic diffusivity modeled as exponential Gaussian process
- f = 0: Source term

**Stochastic Diffusivity Model:**
$$\kappa(z;\omega) = \exp(Y_\kappa(z;\omega))$$

with Yκ(z;ω) defined as a Gaussian process with:
- Mean: μYκ = 1000
- Correlation length: L = 0.3
- Variance: σ²Yκ = 1.0
- Covariance kernel: CovYκ(z₁,z₂) = σ²Yκ exp(-|z₁-z₂|/L)

**Polynomial Chaos Expansion:**
$$T(t,z;\omega) \approx \sum_{i=0}^{P} c_i(t,z) \Psi_i(\omega)$$

where c_i(t,z) are the PCE coefficients learned by the neural network and Ψ_i(ω) are polynomial chaos basis functions.

## Experiments

## Strengths
- **Computational Efficiency**: Enables fast uncertainty propagation without expensive ensemble runs

## Weaknesses
- **Validated on Simplified Model**: Primarily demonstrated on 1D local advection-diffusion equation rather than full 3D ocean circulation models
- **Requires Known Parameter Distributions**: Method assumes parameter uncertainty distributions are known a priori
- **Data Dependency**: Performance depends on quality and quantity of available observational/training data
- **Limited Validation Scope**: No comparison with established uncertainty quantification baselines in experiments

## Research Inspiration

### Directly Reusable Modules
- Exponential Gaussian process prior for stochastic diffusivity modeling (κ(z;ω) = exp(Yκ(z;ω))) can be adapted for other oceanic transport parameters
- Combined PCE-PINN training framework for uncertainty quantification in any PDE-constrained system
- Local advection-diffusion equation implementation as testbed for ocean mixing parameterization research

### Transferable Insights
- Embedding PCE within neural network architectures enables tractable uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional stochastic spaces
- Physics-informed training preserves physical constraints while leveraging data-driven learning
- Surrogate models built from PINNs can enable ensemble-based uncertainty quantification that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive

## Idea Extensions
1. **3D Ocean Circulation Extension**: Extend PCE-PINNs to full 3D ocean circulation models (e.g., MITgcm) to propagate uncertainties in larger-scale ocean dynamics and climate projections
2. **Data Assimilation Integration**: Combine PCE-PINNs with ensemble Kalman filter or 4D-Var data assimilation to update stochastic parameter distributions in real-time as new observations arrive
3. **Multi-Physics Coupling**: Extend to coupled ocean-atmosphere systems with multiple stochastic parameterizations (turbulent mixing, convective adjustment, eddy diffusivity) to quantify compound uncertainties in climate projections
4. **Adaptive PCE Basis**: Develop adaptive polynomial chaos basis selection methods within the neural network to automatically handle non-smooth or localized stochastic features in ocean processes
