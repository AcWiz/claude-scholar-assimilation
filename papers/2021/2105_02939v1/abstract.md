# PCE-PINNs: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Uncertainty Propagation in Ocean Modeling

## TL;DR
PCE-PINNs combine polynomial chaos expansion with physics-informed neural networks for fast uncertainty propagation of parameter uncertainties in ocean modeling.

## Research Question
How can physics-informed neural networks enable fast uncertainty quantification for climate model parameters when ensemble simulations are computationally prohibitive?

## Main Contributions

3. Enables fast surrogate model computation for parameter distributions without expensive ensemble simulations

## Method
PCE-PINNs learn PCE coefficients directly from observations using neural networks. The method approximates stochastic functions via polynomial chaos expansion while leveraging neural networks to estimate PCE coefficients in high-dimensional spaces. The network is trained to approximate PCE coefficients using limited solution measurements as target data, enabling fast inference of uncertainty distributions.
