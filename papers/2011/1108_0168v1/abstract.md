# Particle Kalman Filtering: A Nonlinear Bayesian Framework for Ensemble Kalman Filters

## TL;DR
Particle Kalman Filter (PKF) combines particle filter weight corrections with Kalman filter covariance updates for improved nonlinear Bayesian data assimilation.

## Research Question
How can the strengths of particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters be combined to create a more effective nonlinear Bayesian filtering framework for high-dimensional atmospheric and oceanic data assimilation?

## Main Contributions
1. Proposes Particle Kalman Filter (PKF) using Gaussian mixture representation that combines particle filter weight corrections with Kalman filter state/covariance updates
2. Shows PKF reduces to EnKF when mixture has one component, and approximates particle filter when covariance approaches zero
3. Introduces Particle EnKF (PEnKF) implementation using ensemble of parallel EnKFs with re-sampling to prevent weight collapse

## Method
Gaussian mixture representation of state PDF with N components. Each component updated via Kalman filter. Weight updates use innovation-based correction similar to particle filter but with inflated covariance matrices. Re-sampling step checks entropy criterion to determine when to refresh ensemble. Fraction coefficient c controls interpolation between particle filter (c->0) and EnKF (c->1).

## Datasets
- Lorenz-96 model (40-dimensional) for numerical experiments
- Linear and nonlinear observation operators tested
- Ensemble sizes from 20 to 1000 members

## Core Results
- PEnKF outperforms base EnKF methods in both linear and nonlinear observation scenarios
- PETKF better for small ensembles (m<=40); PSEnKF better for large ensembles
- Re-sampling prevents weight collapse and improves stability
- Optimal number of Gaussian components depends on problem dimensionality

## Limitations
- Computational cost increases with number of Gaussian components
- Performance depends on proper tuning of inflation and localization parameters
- Tested primarily on low-dimensional Lorenz-96 model

## Research Gaps
- Application to realistic high-dimensional ocean/atmosphere models
- Adaptive selection of mixture components
- Integration with localization for large systems
