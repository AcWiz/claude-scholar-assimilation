# Neural Koopman Prior for Data Assimilation

## TL;DR
Neural Koopman prior enables long-term reconstruction and variational data assimilation for irregularly-sampled time series with self-supervised learning.

## Research Question
How can Koopman operator theory combined with neural networks enable data assimilation for irregularly-sampled sequential data?

## Main Contributions
1. Uses neural network architecture leveraging Koopman operator theory to embed dynamical systems in linear latent spaces
2. Enables training for long-term continuous reconstruction even with irregularly-sampled time series
3. Demonstrates self-supervised learning potential using trained dynamical models as priors for variational data assimilation

## Method
Neural Koopman autoencoder architecture learns linear embeddings of nonlinear dynamics. Trained model serves as dynamical prior for variational data assimilation techniques. Enables time series interpolation and forecasting as downstream inverse problems. Uses self-supervised learning requiring no labels. Applied to remote sensing data including Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
