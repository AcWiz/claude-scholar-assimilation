# An Efficient Implementation of the Ensemble Kalman Filter Based on an Iterative Sherman-Morrison Formula

## TL;DR
Iterative Sherman-Morrison formula enables efficient EnKF implementation without matrix decompositions, achieving same accuracy but considerably faster.

## Research Question
How can the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) analysis step be implemented efficiently using iterative Sherman-Morrison formula to avoid costly matrix decompositions?

## Main Contributions
1. Proposes novel EnKF implementation based on iterative Sherman-Morrison formula exploiting ensemble-estimated error covariance matrix structure
2. Achieves computational complexity equivalent to best EnKF implementations when observations >> ensemble members
3. Provides stability analysis with pivoting strategy to reduce round-off error accumulation without increasing computational effort

## Method
Iterative Sherman-Morrison formula for matrix inversion in EnKF analysis step. Exploits block-diagonal structure of measurement error covariance matrix R. Assumes sparse or efficiently-applicable observation operator H. Pivoting strategy for stability. Parallel implementation discussed. Analysis step reformulated to solve linear system efficiently without Cholesky or SVD decompositions.

## Datasets
- Lorenz-96 model (Nens << Nobs regime)
- Oceanic quasi-geostrophic model (Nobs >> Nens regime)
- State space dimensions O(10^7) to O(10^9)
- Observation space dimensions O(10^5) to O(10^7)

## Core Results
- Same accuracy as other EnKF implementations (Cholesky, SVD-based)
- Considerably faster computation time
- Best theoretical complexity among Sherman-Morrison based matrix inversion methods
- Works well when nobs >> nens and when nobs ~= nens
- No matrix decompositions required

## Limitations
- Assumes simple structure for R (block diagonal)
- Requires H to be sparse or efficiently applicable
- Performance depends on observation/ensemble size ratio
- Pivoting strategy adds complexity

## Research Gaps
- Extension to non-block-diagonal R structures
- Adaptive pivoting strategies
- Integration with localization techniques
- Applications to higher-dimensional operational DA systems
