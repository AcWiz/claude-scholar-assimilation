# Bridging ocean wave physics and deep learning: Physics-informed neural operators for nonlinear wavefield reconstruction in real-time

## TL;DR
Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO) reconstruct spatially and temporally phase-resolved nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse buoy and radar measurements without ground truth data.

## Research Question
How can we achieve accurate real-time phase-resolved reconstruction of nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse or indirect measurements without requiring ground truth data during training?

## Main Contributions
1. Proposes a PINO framework that embeds free surface boundary conditions of ocean gravity waves into the loss function, enabling physics-constrained training
2. Enables wave reconstruction from both sparse buoy time-series and radar snapshot measurements without ground truth data
3. Demonstrates accurate real-time reconstruction that generalizes across diverse wave conditions

## Method
The Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework combines neural operator architectures with physics constraints encoded via free surface boundary conditions in the loss function. Training uses High-Order Spectral Method (HOSM) generated synthetic wave data as reference only for post-training evaluation. The approach is mesh-free and learns solution operators for nonlinear wave dynamics.

## Datasets
- Synthetic wave data generated using High-Order Spectral Method (HOSM) for validation
- Buoy time-series measurements for sparse temporal observations
- Radar intensity snapshot measurements for indirect spatial observations

## Core Results
- Accurate reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy and radar measurements
- Real-time capability demonstrated with fast computation relative to physical wave evolution
- Robust generalization across diverse wave conditions without retraining

## Limitations
- Training relies on synthetic wave data; real-world measurement noise characteristics may differ
- Performance may degrade for extreme wave events (rogue waves, breaking waves) not well represented in training data

## Research Gaps
- Extension to operational wave prediction systems with real-time data assimilation
- Validation with additional measurement types (LiDAR, stereo video) and diverse ocean environments
- Integration with wave energy converter control systems for optimized power capture
