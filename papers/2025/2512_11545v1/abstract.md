# Graph Embedding with Mel-spectrograms for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition

## TL;DR
UATR-GTransformer integrates Transformer with GNN for underwater acoustic target recognition, modeling Mel-spectrograms as graphs for non-Euclidean feature extraction.

## Research Question
How can graph neural networks combined with Transformer architectures effectively handle the non-Euclidean structure of underwater acoustic signals for target recognition?

## Main Contributions
1. Proposes UATR-GTransformer, first work to introduce graph structures into underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR)
2. Integrates Transformer Encoder with GNN to capture both global dependencies and local neighborhood relationships in Mel-spectrograms
3. Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while providing interpretability through attention and graph visualization

## Method
Three-component architecture: Mel patchify block, GTransformer block, classification head. Mel patchify converts acoustic signals to Mel-spectrogram and partitions into overlapping patches. GTransformer block uses Transformer Encoder to capture mutual information between split patches, generating Mel-graph embeddings. Each embedding treated as graph node with edges defined by node relationships. GNN enhances embeddings by modeling local neighborhood structure. FFN performs final feature transformation. Non-Euclidean framework explicitly incorporates spatial information from acoustic features. Hinich test validates non-Gaussian and non-linear characteristics of underwater signals.
