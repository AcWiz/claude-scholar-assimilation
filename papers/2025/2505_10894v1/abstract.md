# A Langevinized Ensemble Kalman Filter for Large-Scale Static and Dynamic Learning

## TL;DR
Langevinized EnKF reformulates ensemble Kalman filtering under Langevin dynamics framework, enabling scalable Bayesian online learning with convergence guarantees.

## Research Question
How can ensemble Kalman filtering be extended to enable proper Bayesian uncertainty quantification while maintaining scalability for high-dimensional dynamic systems?

## Main Contributions
1. Reformulates EnKF under Langevin dynamics framework, inheriting forecast-analysis procedure from EnKF and mini-batch data processing from stochastic gradient Langevin algorithms
2. Proves convergence to correct filtering distribution in Wasserstein distance under big data scenario
3. Applies to Lorenz-96 model, high-dimensional variable selection, Bayesian deep learning, and LSTM network learning

## Method
The Langevinized EnKF combines ensemble Kalman filter's forecast-analysis procedure with mini-batch sampling and Langevin diffusion process. This enables scalability with respect to both dimension and sample size. The reformulation converts Bayesian inverse problems into dynamic state estimation problems using subsampling and Langevin diffusion techniques.
