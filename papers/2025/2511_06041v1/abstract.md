# Advancing Ocean State Estimation with efficient and scalable AI

## TL;DR
ADAF-Ocean framework enables direct assimilation of multi-source observations at native resolutions with AI-driven super-resolution, extending global forecast skill by up to 20 days.

## Research Question
How can ocean data assimilation overcome computational scalability bottlenecks and degraded data fidelity from preprocessing while efficiently utilizing diverse heterogeneous observational data?

## Main Contributions
1. Proposes Neural Process-inspired encoder-decoder architecture that directly handles raw multi-source observations without data-degrading preprocessing
2. Achieves AI-driven super-resolution reconstructing 0.25 degree mesoscale dynamics from coarse 1 degree fields with only 3.7% more parameters
3. Demonstrates extended global forecast skill by up to 20 days when coupled with DL forecasting system

## Method
ADAF-Ocean uses a Neural Process-inspired encoder-decoder architecture that learns continuous mappings from heterogeneous inputs (sparse in-situ to 4km satellite swaths) to ocean states. The encoder handles diverse observation types at native resolutions through latent space fusion, while the decoder performs spatio-temporal super-resolution. Training maximizes data fidelity by avoiding interpolation or downsampling preprocessing. Coupled with DL forecast model Triton for initial condition optimization.

## Datasets
- Six types of observations including satellite and in-situ measurements
- GLORYS reanalysis as target for training
- 2018 training, 2019 validation, 2020 testing

## Core Results
- SSH RMSE reduction of approximately 18% compared to background
- Temperature ACC improvement exceeding 6%
- Over 90% of grid points showing MAE reduction for velocity components
- Forecast skill extended by up to 20 days compared to baselines without assimilation

## Limitations
- Requires GPU resources for training the neural network architecture
- Performance depends on quality and coverage of input observations

## Research Gaps
- Extension to subsurface ocean state estimation
- Integration with coupled Earth system models
- Application to real-time operational ocean forecasting
