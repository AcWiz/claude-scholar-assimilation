# Data Assimilation in Operator Algebras

## TL;DR
Algebraic framework embeds Bayesian data assimilation in non-abelian operator algebra, providing positivity-preserving and kernel-method-based computational schemes.

## Research Question
How can algebraic frameworks improve sequential data assimilation for partially observed dynamical systems?

## Main Contributions
1. Develops algebraic framework embedding Bayesian data assimilation in non-abelian operator algebra
2. Represents observables by multiplication operators and probability densities by density operators
3. Projects to finite-dimensional matrix algebras leading to positivity-preserving computational schemes

## Method
The framework uses quantum operation induced by Koopman operator for forecast step and quantum effect for analysis step. Finite-dimensional projection leads to matrix mechanical data assimilation that is automatically positivity-preserving and amenable to consistent data-driven approximation using kernel methods. Natural candidate for quantum computer implementation. Applied to Lorenz 96 multiscale system and El Nino Southern Oscillation in climate model.
