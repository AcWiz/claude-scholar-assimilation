# Enhancing Solutions for Complex PDEs: Introducing Complementary Convolution and Equivariant Attention in Fourier Neural Operators

## TL;DR
Hierarchical FNO with convolution-residual layers and attention mechanisms addresses FNO's limited capability in high-frequency domains for complex PDEs.

## Research Question
How can Fourier Neural Operators be enhanced to better capture high-frequency and rapidly changing solutions in complex PDEs?

## Main Contributions
1. Demonstrates that FNO approximates kernels primarily in low-frequency domain, limiting capability for complex PDEs
2. Proposes hierarchical FNO with convolution-residual layers and attention mechanisms complementary in frequency domain
3. Superior performance on multiscale elliptic equations, Navier-Stokes, and problems with rapid coefficient variations

## Method
Hierarchical Fourier neural operator with convolution-residual layers and attention mechanisms. Convolution kernel translation equivariance complements FNO's Fourier domain approach. Attention mechanism captures interactions across frequency ranges. Architecture addresses spectral bias limitation for high-frequency PDE solutions. Evaluated on forward and reverse problems of multiscale elliptic equations and Navier-Stokes equations.
