# Streamlining Ocean Dynamics Modeling with Fourier Neural Operators: A Multiobjective Hyperparameter and Architecture Optimization Approach

## TL;DR
Multiobjective hyperparameter optimization using DeepHyper improves FNO performance for ocean dynamics, with negative anomaly correlation as additional loss term.

## Research Question
How can automated hyperparameter optimization improve Fourier neural operator performance for ocean dynamics forecasting?

## Main Contributions
1. Leverages DeepHyper for multiobjective optimization of FNO hyperparameters
2. Proposes negative anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) as additional loss term alongside MSE
3. Optimal hyperparameters greatly exceed baseline in autoregressive rollout up to 30 days

## Method
DeepHyper used for automated hyperparameter and architecture optimization of FNOs. Search space includes data preprocessing, architecture, and training hyperparameters. Loss function combines MSE with negative ACC for improved model performance. Optimized for single timestepping and long-horizon autoregressive forecasting. Applied to idealized baroclinic wind-driven ocean system with four prognostic variables.
