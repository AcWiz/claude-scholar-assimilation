# A Lagrangian Conditional Gaussian Koopman Network for Data Assimilation and Prediction

## TL;DR
LaCGKN enables accurate Lagrangian data assimilation and prediction without ensemble methods or governing physical models using structure-preserving neural network architecture.

## Research Question
How can machine learning overcome the fundamental challenges of Lagrangian data assimilation where nonlinear tracer-flow coupling makes posterior inference computationally intractable?

## Main Contributions
1. Develops LaCGKN embedding Eulerian flow dynamics into low-dimensional latent space governed by nonlinear stochastic system with conditional Gaussian structures
2. Incorporates tracer homogenization for permutation equivariance, Fourier-based positional encoding, and SVD-inspired low-rank parameterization
3. Enables analytic posterior updates without ensemble forecasting for Lagrangian observations

## Method
LaCGKN uses Lagrangian conditional Gaussian Koopman network architecture. Tracer homogenization enforces permutation equivariance for generalization across varying tracer numbers. Fourier-based positional encoding captures spatial dependence and reconstructs local flow features. SVD-inspired low-rank parameterization reduces complexity while preserving expressive capacity. Application to two-layer quasi-geostrophic flow demonstrates accurate assimilation and prediction.
