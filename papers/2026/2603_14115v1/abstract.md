# KODA: A Data-Driven Recursive Model for Time Series Forecasting and Data Assimilation using Koopman Operators

## TL;DR
KODA integrates forecasting and data assimilation for nonlinear dynamical systems using Fourier domain filtering to disentangle physical and residual dynamics.

## Research Question
How can Koopman operator-based forecasting be combined with data assimilation to handle nonstationarity and enable long-term prediction with noisy measurements?

## Main Contributions
1. Proposes KODA integrating forecasting and data assimilation using Fourier domain filter to disentangle physical and residual dynamics
2. Uses Koopman operator for physical component dynamics and learnable recursive model for time-varying behavior
3. Introduces coarse correction strategy for data assimilation with new measurements at inference time

## Method
KODA uses Fourier domain filter to decompose data into physical component (captured by Koopman operator) and residual dynamics (captured by flexible learnable recursive model). Architecture ensures stable long-term forecasts through careful design. Coarse correction strategy performs data assimilation with noisy measurements at inference time. Completely data-driven and end-to-end learnable. Evaluated on electricity, temperature, weather, Lorenz 63, and Duffing oscillator benchmarks.

## Datasets

- Temperature data
- Weather data
- Lorenz 63 system
- Duffing oscillator

## Core Results
