# SSTODE: Ocean-Atmosphere Physics-Informed Neural ODEs for Sea Surface Temperature Prediction

## TL;DR
SSTODE uses physics-informed neural ODEs with advection-diffusion dynamics and energy exchanges integrator for interpretable global and regional SST prediction.

## Research Question
How can physics-informed neural ODEs capture ocean-atmosphere interactions for accurate and physically consistent sea surface temperature prediction?

## Main Contributions
1. Derives ODEs from fluid transport principles incorporating advection and diffusion for ocean spatiotemporal dynamics
2. Introduces Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI) accounting for external forcing factors (SW, LW, SHF, LHF)
3. Recovers latent velocity field through variational optimization for explicit governing of SST temporal dynamics

## Method
SSTODE uses physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations framework. The model incorporates advection-diffusion dynamics derived from fluid transport principles. Variational optimization recovers latent velocity field. The Energy Exchanges Integrator encodes ocean heat budget equations for external forcing. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks while maintaining physical consistency and interpretability.
