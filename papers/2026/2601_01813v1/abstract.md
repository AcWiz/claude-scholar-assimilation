# Principled Operator Learning in Ocean Dynamics: The Role of Temporal Structure

## TL;DR
FNOtD with temporal Fourier modes improves long-term prediction stability and captures multiscale wave propagation through dispersion relation learning.

## Research Question
How can temporal structure be incorporated into Fourier neural operators to improve physical fidelity in ocean dynamics?

## Main Contributions
1. Modifies FNO to internalize dispersion relation while learning solution operator for ocean PDEs
2. Entangling space and time in integral kernel training enables capture of multiscale wave propagation
3. FNOtD substantially improves long-term prediction stability compared to standard FNO

## Method
FNOtD parameterizes integral kernels jointly over space and time, rather than mapping current state to next timestep at fixed interval. This allows operator to internalize dispersion relations crucial for ocean wave physics. Architecture enables principled zero-shot super-resolution and effective training on limited datasets. Compared against standard FNO and state-of-the-art numerical ocean model.

- Competitive predictive skill with numerical ocean model
- Lower computational cost than numerical simulation

## Limitations
- Validated on regional scale; generalizability to global ocean unclear
- Requires careful tuning of temporal frequency truncation
- Performance depends on training data coverage

## Research Gaps
- Extension to global ocean modeling
- Integration with data assimilation
- Application to climate-scale predictions
