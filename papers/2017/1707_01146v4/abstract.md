# Data-driven Discovery of Koopman Eigenfunctions for Control

## TL;DR
KRONIC framework validates Koopman eigenfunctions and constructs reduced-order models in intrinsic coordinates for nonlinear system control.

## Research Question
How can Koopman eigenfunctions be validated and used to construct improved reduced-order models for nonlinear system control?

## Main Contributions
1. Illustrates fundamental closure issue in finite-dimensional Koopman approximations and proposes validation approach
2. Demonstrates that lightly damped eigenfunctions can be faithfully extracted from EDMD for control applications
3. Proposes KRONIC (Koopman Reduced Order Nonlinear Identification and Control) architecture for control in eigenfunction coordinates

## Method
The method first validates eigenfunctions by checking their Koopman-invariant properties, then constructs reduced-order models in these validated coordinates. Eigenfunctions are approximated using data-driven regression and power series expansions based on the PDE governing the infinitesimal generator. Control is formulated directly in intrinsic Koopman coordinates, where dynamics are linear by design.
